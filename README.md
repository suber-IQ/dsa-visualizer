## 📌 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔷 1. Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a particular order.
- 🟢 **Bubble Sort** – A simple comparison-based algorithm.
- 🟢 **Selection Sort** – Repeatedly selects the smallest element.
- 🟢 **Insertion Sort** – Efficient for small datasets.
- 🔵 **Merge Sort** – A divide-and-conquer approach.
- 🔵 **Quick Sort** – Uses partitioning to sort efficiently.

### 🔶 2. Searching Algorithms
Searching algorithms help in finding an element in a dataset.
- 🔍 **Linear Search** – Iterates through the list sequentially.
- 🔍 **Binary Search** – Uses a divide-and-conquer strategy (requires sorted input).

### 🔷 3. Graph Algorithms
Graph-based techniques are widely used in networking, maps, and AI.
- 🟣 **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** – Explores neighbors before deeper nodes.
- 🟣 **DFS (Depth-First Search)** – Explores as far as possible before backtracking.
- 🟣 **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – Finds the shortest path in weighted graphs.
- 🟡 **Prim’s Algorithm** – Constructs a minimum spanning tree.
- 🟡 **Kruskal’s Algorithm** – Another method for minimum spanning tree construction.

### 🔶 4. Dynamic Programming
Optimized solutions by breaking problems into subproblems.
- 🔢 **Fibonacci Sequence** – Uses memoization for efficiency.
- 🎒 **Knapsack Problem** – Optimizes item selection for maximum value.
- 📖 **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** – Finds the longest matching sequence.
- 📈 **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** – Determines the longest ascending subsequence.

### 🔷 5. Greedy Algorithms
Algorithms that make the best local choice at each step.
- ⏳ **Activity Selection Problem** – Selects maximum non-overlapping activities.
- 🗜 **Huffman Coding** – Used in data compression for optimal encoding.

### 🔶 6. Backtracking
A trial-and-error approach to explore all possible solutions.
- ♟ **N-Queens Problem** – Places N queens on an NxN chessboard.
- 🧩 **Sudoku Solver** – Solves Sudoku puzzles using constraint satisfaction.

### 🌳 7. Tree Algorithms
Tree structures are fundamental to hierarchical data representation.
- 🌿 **Tree Traversals** – Preorder, Inorder, Postorder traversals.
- 🌳 **Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations** – Insert, delete, search.
- 🔄 **AVL Tree Rotations** – Self-balancing BST with rotation operations.
- 🔍 **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** – Finds the closest common ancestor of two nodes.

### 🔢 8. Mathematical Algorithms
Mathematical computations and number theory algorithms.
- 🔢 **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) - Euclidean Algorithm** – Efficient GCD computation.
- 🧮 **Sieve of Eratosthenes** – Finds all prime numbers up to a given limit.
